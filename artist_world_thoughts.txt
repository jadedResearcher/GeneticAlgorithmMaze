in the artist world, creatures don't need to eat.

They still navigate by pheremones (modular, maybe can turn on and off?)

blocks don't have plants. instead, they have rgb color values.

every tick a creature is on a block, they desposit a small amount of color (based on DNA, make it RGB instead of RLUD?)

creatures move towards pheremones and/or dna.

can put creatures down. can reset block to white.
